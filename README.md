That's an online shop where people can order food. We used Javascript + HTML/CSS on the frontend and Node.JS + Express and MongoDB on the backend.

To open our website:

After cloning from our master branch, please open the folder "backend" run "npm install" then "node index.js" in your terminal. Once it's done please open the second terminal, run "npm install" then "npm start". The website should be opened automatically.
