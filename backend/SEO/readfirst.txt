Basically, React is more customisable, faster and makes pages really responsive.
This makes it better for any website and beats by 2-3 times a Wordpress app in term of speed.
This should be one of your main argument when a client wants a quality website that loads 
fast ( less people are gonna bounce away). It makes a huge difference for sales and customer
experience. 

Big downside is that React, while behing very customisable, does not come with SEO plugins
like YOAST for wordpress and since it is a single page app this gives google analytics a hard
time. That is why alot of compagnies prefers wordpress or static HTML pages, it is much more 
easy to keep track of statistics and improve the website content, so more money. In order to 
solve that issue, we need to make sure that we can make the app crawler friendly so we get 
the best of both world, speed and responsivness of React and accurate tracking with google
analytics and other tools that are used across the industry. So yes React is powerfull but 
with great power comes great responsability.



SEO (Search Engine Optimisation)

As I discussed, I will try to optimise our app for SEO and at the same time 
explain the logic so you guys can re-use it on further jobs or contracts.

If you want to know specifically the actions for our current web app or just a cheat sheet
go to the actions.txt in the same folder. 

If you want to further your knowledge go to the seobasics.txt file in the same 
folder. 

I spoke with a few web agencies and recruiters and SEO skills are super 
important and  overlooked so it will be a great tool in your arsenal to 
know the basics.
